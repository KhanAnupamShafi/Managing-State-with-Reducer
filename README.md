## [Extracting State Logic into a Reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

### React Composition - Basic Crud Project

This project is for understanding basic component composition which shows how to [transform state](https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) using crud operations with useState and useReducer

Reducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from useState to useReducer in three steps:

- Move from setting state to dispatching actions.
- Write a reducer function.
- Use the reducer from your component.
